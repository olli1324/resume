        "explanation": "Atomic actions are essential for damage confinement and assessment when errors occur in concurrent systems.",
        "detailedExplanation": "Atomic actions serve as a fundamental mechanism for structuring concurrent programs to facilitate damage confinement and error recovery. When tasks interact and communicate, atomic actions constrain information flow to well-defined boundaries, making it possible to assess the damage scope and implement appropriate recovery procedures without affecting the entire system.",

        "explanation": "Atomic actions appear indivisible and instantaneous to other tasks, with effects as if they were interleaved rather than concurrent.",
        "detailedExplanation": "The key property of atomic actions is that they can be considered indivisible and instantaneous from the perspective of tasks outside the action. This means the effects on the system appear as if the tasks were executed sequentially (interleaved) rather than concurrently.

As each task tries to recover to a previous state, it may invalidate the states of other tasks that have communicated with it, forcing them to also roll back.
