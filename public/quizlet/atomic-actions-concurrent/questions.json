At runtime, a scheduler allocates specific time budgets to these tasks. When the allocated time expires, the task must be interrupted to stop further refinement and return the current result.

        "explanation": "Asynchronous exceptions make it difficult to write safe code because they can be delivered at unpredictable times.",
        "detailedExplanation": "The main challenge with asynchronous exceptions is that they can be delivered at any time during program execution, making it extremely difficult to write code that can safely handle them. Every method would potentially need handlers for asynchronous exceptions, and the unpredictable timing makes it hard to ensure data consistency and proper resource cleanup. Real-Time Java addresses this by requiring methods to explicitly declare their willingness to handle asynchronous exceptions.",

        "detailedExplanation": "Forward error recovery handles errors by continuing program execution after taking corrective action, rather than rolling back to a previous state. This approach is often necessary when backward recovery is impossible (e.g., after interacting with the physical environment) or when the cost of rollback is too high.

In the termination model, the exception handler is executed, but control does not return to the point of exception - instead, execution continues from the handler's location.

If a new AIE comes in at a higher level, it discards any AIE at lower levels. If a new AIE comes in at a lower level, it is discarded because the higher-level AIE takes precedence.

In traditional atomic action models, all expected tasks must participate before any can complete. However, in real-time systems where deadlines are important, this can be problematic.
