    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "Failfast creates a need for instant crash and restart, allowing systems to recover quickly from failures.",
    "detailedExplanation": "Failfast is a fault tolerance approach where systems are designed to fail quickly and restart immediately when problems are detected. This prevents cascading failures and allows for rapid recovery. The concept of process pairs mentioned in the document builds on this - if one process fails, the other can take over almost instantly (within a second).",

    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The Olympian view involves two identical systems in different places with largely independent failure modes.",
    "detailedExplanation": "The document describes the Olympian view as having system pairs in two different locations where the second system has all the data of the first and receives updates. They have independent operations staff, different maintenance personnel, different hardware, different power grids, phone grids, and earthquake faults. This geographic and infrastructure diversity ensures that failures affecting one system are unlikely to affect the backup.",

    "explanation": "The document identifies N-version programming and transactions as the two main approaches to software fault tolerance.",
    "detailedExplanation": "N-version programming involves creating several independent implementations of the same program and comparing their outputs to detect errors. Transactions provide atomicity and consistency guarantees, allowing systems to maintain consistent state even in the presence of failures.

    "explanation": "Storage decay models how pages may fail spontaneously over time due to various factors.",
    "detailedExplanation": "The document explains that storage decay is modeled by a decay process for each store. Pages can fail due to incorrect addressing, wear-out, or spontaneous failures in the background. The model uses exponential distribution with parameters like MTSF (Mean Time To Store Failure) to simulate realistic failure patterns.

    "explanation": "reliable_write() attempts to write to all members of the n-plex group.",
    "detailedExplanation": "In the N-plexed storage approach described in the document, reliable_write() tries to write the same data to all n members of the storage group. Each reliable_read() then attempts to read all members of the group. The write operation returns success if it can write to at least one member, providing fault tolerance through redundancy.

    "explanation": "Optimistic reads are dangerous because they may return stale data if recent writes to some replicas failed.",
    "detailedExplanation": "The document warns that optimistic reading is dangerous because if one of the n store_write() operations fails within a reliable_storage_write() operation, some storage devices may have different page versions.

    "detailedExplanation": "The document distinguishes between expected and unexpected faults. Expected faults are those that the system is designed to handle gracefully - they are anticipated and the system has mechanisms to detect and recover from them. Unexpected faults are those that the system cannot handle and typically result in system failure or undefined behavior.

    "explanation": "Byzantine faults are characterized by arbitrary behavior where the system may not conform to its specification in unpredictable ways.",
    "detailedExplanation": "Byzantine faults represent the most general class of faults where a component may exhibit completely arbitrary behavior - it might send conflicting messages to different recipients, produce incorrect outputs, or behave maliciously. These faults are particularly challenging because they cannot be easily detected by simple mechanisms and require sophisticated protocols like Byzantine agreement algorithms to handle properly.",

    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Checkpoint-restart allows processes to periodically save their state and restart from that saved state after a failure.",
    "detailedExplanation": "The document describes checkpoint-restart as a fundamental technique for fault tolerance. Processes periodically save their complete state (checkpoint) to stable storage. When a failure occurs, the process can be restarted from the most recent checkpoint rather than from the beginning. This significantly reduces recovery time and provides a practical approach to handling process failures, especially for long-running computations.",

    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "When the primary fails, the backup detects the failure and takes over, becoming the new primary.",
    "detailedExplanation": "The document explains that in process pairs, the backup process continuously monitors the primary. When the primary fails, the backup detects this (often through missed heartbeat messages) and takes over as the new primary. A new backup process is then typically started. This provides very fast failover times - often measured in seconds - and maintains service availability even in the presence of individual process failures.",

      "Better performance"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Process pairs provide much faster takeover times compared to checkpoint-restart recovery.",
    "detailedExplanation": "While checkpoint-restart requires reading the checkpoint from stable storage and rebuilding process state (which can take significant time), process pairs maintain a live backup that already has the current state. This allows takeover to happen in seconds rather than minutes or hours. The document notes that this improvement over the availability offered by checkpoint-restart can be quite significant for time-critical applications.",

    "explanation": "'I'm Alive' messages are heartbeat signals that allow the backup to detect primary process failures.",
    "detailedExplanation": "The document describes 'I'm Alive' messages as periodic heartbeat signals sent from the primary to the backup process. If the backup doesn't receive these messages for a certain period, it assumes the primary has failed and initiates takeover procedures.

    "explanation": "Persistent processes maintain their state in stable storage, allowing them to survive system failures.",
    "detailedExplanation": "The document explains that persistent processes are designed to survive system crashes by storing their critical state in stable storage (like databases or transaction-protected files). When the system restarts after a failure, these processes can recover their state and continue operation.

    "explanation": "A session is a bidirectional message pipe between two processes that provides reliable message delivery.",
    "detailedExplanation": "The document defines sessions as abstractions that provide reliable message delivery between processes. They implement semantics where messages are delivered in order and exactly once, even in the presence of failures.

    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The acknowledgment mechanism prevents message duplication and loss by tracking which messages have been successfully delivered.",
    "detailedExplanation": "Sessions use sequence numbers and acknowledgments to ensure reliable delivery. Each message gets a unique sequence number, and the receiver acknowledges receipt. If acknowledgments are not received within a timeout period, messages are retransmitted. The receiver can detect and discard duplicate messages using sequence numbers, ensuring exactly-once delivery semantics.",

    "explanation": "The main challenge is maintaining consistency across replicas when some storage devices fail during operations.",
    "detailedExplanation": "The document highlights that in n-plexed systems, partial failures during write operations can leave some replicas with old data and others with new data.

    "explanation": "Process pairs provide continuous availability because the backup can take over immediately when the primary fails.",
    "detailedExplanation": "With checkpoint-restart, there's always a service interruption while the process restarts and recovers its state from the checkpoint. Process pairs eliminate this interruption because the backup process is already running and can take over immediately. This provides much better availability characteristics, especially for real-time or interactive applications where service interruptions are unacceptable.",

    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Design diversity involves creating multiple independent implementations to avoid common design flaws.",
    "detailedExplanation": "The document discusses design diversity as a way to protect against systematic faults that might affect all copies of the same software. By having independent teams create different implementations of the same specification, the resulting systems are less likely to share common bugs or design flaws. This is the principle behind N-version programming, where multiple versions vote on results to detect and mask software errors.",

    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Timeouts detect when messages or acknowledgments are lost and trigger retransmission mechanisms.",
    "detailedExplanation": "In reliable messaging systems, timeouts are essential for detecting failures. When a sender doesn't receive an acknowledgment within the expected time, it assumes the message was lost and retransmits it. Similarly, receivers use timeouts to detect missing messages in a sequence. Without timeouts, the system couldn't distinguish between slow delivery and lost messages, making reliable delivery impossible.",

    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Byzantine fault tolerance is challenging because faulty components can exhibit arbitrary behavior, making it difficult to distinguish correct from incorrect behavior.",
    "detailedExplanation": "Byzantine faults are the most general and difficult class of faults because a Byzantine component can send different (and possibly contradictory) messages to different recipients, behave correctly sometimes and incorrectly other times, or even appear to cooperate while actually working against the system goals. Protocols must be designed to reach consensus despite such arbitrary behavior, typically requiring sophisticated voting mechanisms and multiple rounds of communication.",

    "explanation": "The document advocates for simplicity, suggesting that simpler systems are easier to understand, verify, and make fault-tolerant.",
    "detailedExplanation": "The document includes general principles emphasizing 'Keep It Simple, Stupid!' (KISS) and Murphy's Law. Simple systems have fewer potential failure modes, are easier to reason about, and have fewer opportunities for bugs. While fault tolerance mechanisms themselves may add some complexity, the underlying system design should be as simple as possible to minimize the chances of faults and make the system easier to verify and maintain.",

    "explanation": "Checksums detect data corruption by comparing stored and computed values when data is read.",
    "detailedExplanation": "The document describes how checksums are computed when data is written and stored alongside the data. When the data is later read, the checksum is recomputed and compared with the stored checksum. If they don't match, it indicates that the data has been corrupted, allowing the system to detect storage faults and take appropriate recovery actions such as reading from an alternate replica.",

    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Takeover time is how long it takes for the backup process to detect the primary's failure and take over its responsibilities.",
    "detailedExplanation": "The document emphasizes that takeover times are critical for availability. In process pairs, this includes the time to detect the primary failure (through missed heartbeats), the time to initialize the backup as the new primary, and any time needed to establish new connections or notify clients. Minimizing takeover time is essential for high availability, with the document suggesting takeover times on the order of seconds rather than minutes.",

    "explanation": "The frequency balances the need for quick failure detection against the overhead of frequent messaging.",
    "detailedExplanation": "More frequent 'I'm Alive' messages allow faster failure detection but increase network and processing overhead. Less frequent messages reduce overhead but increase the time to detect failures. The document suggests that this tradeoff must be carefully tuned based on the application's availability requirements and the acceptable level of system overhead.",

    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Murphy's Law suggests that potential failures will occur, especially at inconvenient times, so systems must be designed accordingly.",
    "detailedExplanation": "The document references Murphy's Law as a guiding principle for fault-tolerant design. It suggests that designers should assume that anything that can fail will fail, and probably at the most inconvenient moment. This philosophy drives the need for comprehensive fault tolerance mechanisms and careful consideration of all possible failure scenarios, rather than assuming that failures are rare or unlikely.",

    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Independent failure modes ensure that redundant components don't all fail from the same cause.",
    "detailedExplanation": "The document emphasizes that true redundancy requires independent failure modes. If redundant components share common failure causes (same power supply, same software version, same environmental conditions), they might all fail simultaneously, defeating the purpose of redundancy. Geographic diversity, design diversity, and operational diversity all contribute to achieving independent failure modes.",

    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "State synchronization ensures the backup maintains the same state as the primary, enabling seamless takeover.",
    "detailedExplanation": "For process pairs to work effectively, the backup must maintain state that's sufficiently current with the primary to take over seamlessly. This requires mechanisms to synchronize state updates, which might include checkpointing messages, state transfer protocols, or real-time state replication. The document discusses various approaches to achieving this synchronization while balancing performance and consistency requirements.",

    "explanation": "Exactly-once delivery requires preventing both message loss and duplication, which can be challenging in the presence of failures.",
    "detailedExplanation": "The document shows that implementing exactly-once semantics requires careful handling of various failure scenarios. Messages might be lost, duplicated, or reordered during transmission. The system must use acknowledgments to detect loss, sequence numbers to detect duplicates, and timeouts to handle non-responses, all while ensuring that the recovery mechanisms themselves don't introduce additional duplicates or losses.",

    "explanation": "End-to-end reliability requires ensuring reliability across all components in the complete communication path.",
    "detailedExplanation": "The document emphasizes that true reliability requires an end-to-end approach. It's not sufficient to make individual components reliable if the interfaces between them can fail. For example, a message might be successfully delivered to a process but lost if the process crashes before processing it. End-to-end reliability requires mechanisms that ensure the complete operation succeeds, often requiring acknowledgments at the application level.",

    "explanation": "Version numbers help detect when some replicas have newer data than others, maintaining consistency.",
    "detailedExplanation": "In the n-plex storage model described, version numbers are used to track the recency of data across multiple replicas. When a write operation fails on some replicas but succeeds on others, version numbers help identify which replicas have the most recent data.

    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Graceful degradation allows systems to continue operating with reduced capabilities rather than failing completely.",
    "detailedExplanation": "The document implies that well-designed fault-tolerant systems should degrade gracefully when components fail. Rather than complete system failure, the system continues to provide service with reduced performance or functionality.
