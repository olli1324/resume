    "question": "What characterizes the 'fail-stop' failure model in distributed systems?",
    "options": [
      "Components continue operating but produce incorrect results occasionally",
      "Components stop functioning completely and detectably when they fail",
      "Components alternate between working and non-working states randomly",
      "Components gradually degrade in performance before eventually failing"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Fail-stop components stop completely and other components can detect the failure.",
    "detailedExplanation": "In the fail-stop model, when a component fails, it simply stops responding rather than producing incorrect outputs. Other components can easily detect this type of failure through timeouts or missing heartbeat messages, making it easier to implement fault tolerance mechanisms.",
    "topic": "failure-models"

    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "Timeouts can't differentiate between slow responses and genuine failures.",
    "detailedExplanation": "The fundamental problem with timeout-based failure detection is that a slow or delayed response is indistinguishable from a failure. The system might incorrectly assume a component has failed when it's just temporarily slow, leading to unnecessary failover actions and potential system instability.",

    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "Reliable messaging must handle lost, duplicate, corrupted, and out-of-order messages.",
    "detailedExplanation": "The document identifies these four main problems with message delivery: messages can be lost in transit, delivered multiple times, arrive with corrupted data, or arrive in a different order than sent. Reliable message systems must detect and handle all these scenarios to provide applications with dependable communication.",

    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "End-to-end argument emphasizes that fault tolerance requires whole-system consideration.",
    "detailedExplanation": "The end-to-end principle suggests that certain functions, including fault tolerance, can only be correctly implemented with knowledge and help from the application endpoints. Lower-level mechanisms alone cannot provide complete fault tolerance - the entire system must be designed with fault tolerance in mind.",
