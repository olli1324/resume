    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "The most important consideration is that the name fully and accurately describes the entity the variable represents.",
    "detailedExplanation": "According to Code Complete, an effective technique for coming up with a good name is to state in words what the variable represents. That statement itself is often the best variable name. It's readable, unambiguous, and won't be confused with something else.

    "detailedExplanation": "While avoiding duplicate code and improving performance are valid reasons, the primary purpose is intellectual manageability.

An ADT might be a graphics window with all operations that affect it, a file and file operations, or an insurance-rates table and operations on it.

    "detailedExplanation": "Each class should implement one and only one ADT. If you find a class implementing more than one ADT, or can't determine what ADT the class implements, it's time to reorganize.

    "detailedExplanation": "Barbara Liskov argued that you shouldn't inherit from a base class unless the derived class truly 'is a' more specific version of the base class.

    "explanation": "Problem orientation focuses on 'what' (the problem domain) rather than 'how' (the computing solution).",
    "detailedExplanation": "A good mnemonic name generally speaks to the problem rather than the solution. Names that refer to computing aspects represent 'how' rather than 'what.'

While abstraction helps manage complexity by providing models that ignore implementation details, encapsulation prevents you from seeing the details even if you want to.

    "explanation": "Be leery of 'temporary' variables - they often indicate you aren't sure of their real purpose.",
    "detailedExplanation": "Most variables in your program are temporary in some way. Calling a few 'temporary' may indicate unclear purpose. Instead of 'temp = sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c)', use 'discriminant = sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c)' which describes what the variable actually represents. This makes the code more readable and the variable's purpose clear.",

    "question": "What is the recommended way to organize routine parameters?",
    "options": [
      "Alphabetically",
      "By data type",
      "Input-modify-output order",
      "Most important parameters first"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "Put parameters in input-modify-output order to reflect the sequence of operations within the routine.",
    "detailedExplanation": "List input-only parameters first, input-and-output second, and output-only third. This ordering implies the sequence of operations: inputting data, changing it, and sending back a result. This convention makes parameter lists more predictable and easier to understand, though it conflicts with some C-library conventions.",

    "question": "What is the key principle behind good class interfaces?",
    "options": [
      "Expose all internal details for flexibility",
      "Provide services that clearly belong together",
      "Have as many methods as possible",
      "Always use inheritance"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "A class interface should offer a group of routines that clearly belong together and present a consistent abstraction.",
    "detailedExplanation": "The class's interface should provide an abstraction of the implementation hidden behind it. Every routine in the interface should work toward a consistent end. For example, an Employee class with routines like GetName(), GetAddress(), GetWorkPhone() presents a good abstraction, while a class mixing employee operations with report formatting operations presents a poor abstraction.",

    "question": "When should you use multiple inheritance?",
    "options": [
      "Always, for maximum flexibility",
      "Never, it's too dangerous",
      "Primarily for mixins - simple classes that add properties",
      "Only in academic settings"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "Multiple inheritance is useful primarily for defining mixins - simple classes used to add a set of properties to an object.",
    "detailedExplanation": "Mixins are called mixins because they allow properties to be 'mixed in' to derived classes. Examples include Displayable, Persistent, Serializable, or Sortable. They're nearly always abstract and aren't meant to be instantiated independently. They make design more comprehensible by 'chunking' attributes together, but should be used carefully as multiple inheritance opens up complexities that don't exist with single inheritance.",

    "question": "What is the Book Paradigm for program documentation?",
    "options": [
      "Writing documentation in book format",
      "Organizing code like a book with preface, table of contents, and sections",
      "Using only written documentation",
      "Avoiding all inline comments"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The Book Paradigm organizes code documentation like a book with preface, table of contents, sections, and cross-references.",
    "detailedExplanation": "Research by Oman and Cook found that organizing code documentation like a book improved comprehension by 10-20%. The 'preface' provides program overview, 'table of contents' shows top-level organization, 'sections' divide routines into logical parts, and 'cross-references' provide navigation. This approach supports both high-level understanding and detailed code reading.",
