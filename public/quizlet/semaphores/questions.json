    "explanation": "Condition variables allow threads to wait for arbitrary conditions while atomically releasing and reacquiring a mutex.",
    "detailedExplanation": "Condition variables solve the problem of waiting for complex conditions while holding a mutex. With semaphores, a thread must release a mutex before waiting, creating a race condition where the condition might change before the wait begins. Condition variables atomically release the mutex and begin waiting, then reacquire the mutex when signaled.

    "detailedExplanation": "The barbershop problem models finite capacity constraints. When all n chairs (waiting room + barber chair) are occupied, additional customers cannot enter and must balk - they leave without service. This models real-world scenarios with space constraints. The solution uses a counter to track occupancy and checks capacity before allowing customers to enter. This balking behavior is different from blocking, where customers would wait indefinitely for space.",

    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Local variables are thread-specific, eliminating the need for synchronization since there's no sharing.",
    "detailedExplanation": "Local variables (typically allocated on each thread's stack) are private to each thread, so there's no sharing and no need for synchronization. This is in contrast to global variables or heap-allocated objects that are shared among threads. Using local variables when possible is a good strategy for avoiding synchronization complexity.

    "explanation": "Message passing avoids shared state, eliminating race conditions and making concurrent programs easier to reason about.",
    "detailedExplanation": "Message passing synchronization avoids the complexities of shared memory by having threads communicate through explicit message sends and receives. Since there's no shared mutable state, there are no race conditions, no need for locks, and no possibility of deadlock from lock dependencies.

    "detailedExplanation": "This distinction is important for proper semaphore usage. With structure semantics (like in POSIX semaphores), assigning a semaphore to a variable creates a copy of the semaphore's internal state, which is almost always wrong since you end up with two independent semaphores.

This means adults create capacity for children (each adult allows 3 children), but adults cannot leave if it would violate the ratio.

    "explanation": "Bounded waiting guarantees that no thread waits indefinitely, providing starvation-freedom.",
    "detailedExplanation": "Bounded waiting is a fairness property that ensures any thread waiting for a resource will eventually get it within a finite, bounded amount of time. This prevents starvation scenarios where some threads wait indefinitely while others repeatedly access resources.

    "explanation": "The judge cannot confirm until all immigrants who entered have also completed the check-in process.",
    "detailedExplanation": "The Faneuil Hall problem requires that immigrants first enter, then check in, before the judge can perform confirmation. The synchronization constraint ensures that no immigrant who has entered is left out of the ceremony due to incomplete check-in.

    "detailedExplanation": "Spurious wakeups are a well-known phenomenon where threads waiting on condition variables wake up even though no thread explicitly signaled them. This can happen due to system signals, hardware interrupts, or implementation details of the threading library. It's why condition variable waits should always be in loops that recheck the actual condition - the standard pattern is 'while (!condition) wait()' rather than 'if (!condition) wait()'.

    "detailedExplanation": "In the basic turnstile pattern, threads pass through one at a time, with each thread signaling the next. This can cause unnecessary context switching. The preloaded turnstile optimization has the controlling thread signal the semaphore multiple times (equal to the number of waiting threads), allowing all waiting threads to pass through quickly without individual signaling.

    "detailedExplanation": "Even if a semaphore provides a way to read its current value, this is generally unsafe in concurrent programs. By the time you read the value and make a decision based on it, other threads may have modified the semaphore, making your decision incorrect.

    "detailedExplanation": "The rendezvous pattern is fundamental for two-way synchronization where both threads have constraints on each other. Unlike one-way signaling where Thread A waits for Thread B to complete something, rendezvous ensures Thread A waits for Thread B AND Thread B waits for Thread A.

    "detailedExplanation": "The scoreboard pattern uses shared variables (like counters) protected by a mutex to maintain system state that threads can check and update. Threads acquire the mutex, examine the 'scoreboard' variables to understand the current situation, and then decide how to proceed based on what they find.

    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The nth thread triggers the barrier release, allowing all n threads to proceed past the synchronization point.",
    "detailedExplanation": "A barrier ensures that no thread proceeds past a certain point until all n threads have reached that point. The first n-1 threads that arrive are blocked. When the nth (final) thread arrives, it signals the barrier which releases all the waiting threads. This creates a synchronization point where all threads rendezvous before continuing execution.

    "explanation": "Starvation occurs when a thread is perpetually denied access to resources it needs.",
    "detailedExplanation": "Starvation happens when a thread waits indefinitely for a resource or condition while other threads continue to proceed. Unlike deadlock where all involved threads are stuck, in starvation some threads make progress while others are consistently bypassed.

Weak semaphores only guarantee that when a thread signals, some waiting thread will be awakened, but don't specify which one. This can lead to starvation where some threads wait indefinitely. Strong semaphores maintain a FIFO queue, ensuring that threads are awakened in the order they started waiting, providing bounded waiting time.

    "detailedExplanation": "The classic deadlock in dining philosophers occurs when all five philosophers simultaneously pick up their right fork, then each tries to pick up their left fork. Since each philosopher's left fork is another philosopher's right fork, and all right forks are already taken, every philosopher waits indefinitely for a fork that will never become available.

    "detailedExplanation": "The H2O problem requires that threads wait until they can form complete water molecules. Two hydrogen threads and one oxygen thread must arrive before any of them can proceed to bond. This creates groups of three threads that must synchronize together.

Instead, a mutex can be 'passed' from one thread to another, where the first thread acquires it and a different thread releases it.

    "detailedExplanation": "Atomicity means an operation either completes entirely or doesn't happen at all - there's no visible intermediate state. In concurrent programming, this is crucial because non-atomic operations like incrementing a variable (read-modify-write) can be interrupted between steps, leading to race conditions. For example, if two threads increment a counter simultaneously, without atomicity they might both read the same value, increment it, and write back the same result, effectively losing one increment.

Santa sleeps until awakened by either: (1) all 9 reindeer returning from vacation, or (2) exactly 3 elves having problems.

    "explanation": "Multiple smokers can be awakened by the same signal, causing them to compete for ingredients and potentially deadlock.",
    "detailedExplanation": "The naive approach where each smoker waits directly on ingredient semaphores fails because when the agent signals two ingredients, multiple smokers might wake up. For example, if tobacco and paper are signaled, both the smoker-with-matches and smoker-with-tobacco might wake up and try to take the same ingredients.

    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Reusable barriers can be used repeatedly in loops, resetting themselves after all threads pass through.",
    "detailedExplanation": "A simple barrier opens when all threads arrive and stays open. This works for one-time synchronization but fails in loops where threads need to synchronize repeatedly. A reusable barrier automatically resets itself after all threads have passed through, becoming ready for the next round of synchronization.

    "explanation": "Multiplex controls the number of threads that can access a resource simultaneously.",
    "detailedExplanation": "The multiplex pattern generalizes mutual exclusion by allowing up to n threads (instead of just 1) to access a resource concurrently. It's implemented using a semaphore initialized to n, where each thread must acquire the semaphore before entering and release it when leaving.

    "explanation": "It's categorical mutual exclusion: multiple men OR multiple women, but not both simultaneously.",
    "detailedExplanation": "The unisex bathroom problem is an example of categorical mutual exclusion, which is more complex than simple mutual exclusion. Instead of allowing only one thread at a time, it allows multiple threads of the same category (men or women) while completely excluding the other category.

    "explanation": "Non-determinism means the execution order of concurrent threads cannot be predicted from the program code.",
    "detailedExplanation": "Non-determinism is a fundamental characteristic of concurrent programs. Even with identical input and code, different runs can produce different thread interleavings and potentially different outputs. This happens because thread scheduling depends on many factors outside the program's control: other processes, interrupts, cache states, etc. While synchronization primitives like semaphores ensure correctness properties (like mutual exclusion), they don't eliminate non-determinism - multiple correct execution orders usually exist.",

Instead, the thread that already holds the mutex does the work on behalf of waiting threads before releasing the mutex.
